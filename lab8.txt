Nathaniel SchubLab 8 w205Submission 1: 5377 rows are missing a state. I got this by facet/filtering on the states column, which groups all rows by state. Blank is at the bottom with 5377 rows.Submission 2: 4362 rows are missing a zip code. Submission 3: There are 34961 invalid rows and 349537 valid rows.Submission 4: When we increase the radius to 3, in addition to clustering several California and Alaskas, which we saw with radius of 2, it wants to merge Tajikistan and Pakistan as well as Indonesia and Micronesia, which would not be good.Submission 5: California and Caliofrnia would be good to merge, as would Canada and Cnaada Submission 6: Clustering the Place column is problematic- it cannot find matches because, likely because the places are dissimilar enough and there is enough text that is not common. For ecample, California and Caliofornia would not be matched because the Place column numbers, exact locations in addition to larger places. This is why we split out after the last column so that we could have a larger, more common term to match on. Submission 7: Levenshtein distance =3
